trying to get a smooth PTZ control / display in my Home Assistant setup. 
got it to work using a picture-glance card with controls. however the PTZ control is very sluggish and looking to improve on that.

on a side note I did not find any information for my specifica camera in this document: https://www.foscam.es/descarga/Foscam-IPCamera-CGI-User-Guide-AllPlatforms-2015.11.06.pdf
